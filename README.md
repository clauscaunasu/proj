Develop an implementation that computes the MST as follows: Start with
a graph containing all of the edges. Then repeatedly go through the edges in decreasing order of weight.
For each edge, check if deleting that edge will disconnect the graph;
if not, delete it. Prove that this
algorithm computes the MST
